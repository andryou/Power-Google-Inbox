# Power Google Inbox
Tweak Google Inbox to see and do more at once.

NOTE: Google regularly pushes updates that break this extension => to fix this, I have to go through all the identifiers and update them and push an update - go to the Options page, temporarily untick the options, and re-tick them after a day or two.

## Features
* create a "Compact" display density so that you are able to view more messages in a glance
* permanently dock the left-hand navigation menu on screens that are at least 1280 pixels in width
* make it so the "drawer" icon in the top-left corner will by default open your Inbox
* hide message reminders
* highlight bundles in yellow to distinguish them against individual emails
* make the compose window larger
* allow you to control which of the above tweaks you want to apply by clicking on the Google Inbox icon with the yellow + sign

## To Use
1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/power-google-inbox/onljdklnkcfecedfepomkloibkobiakh (or download this repo and load as a local extension)
2. (optional) Allow in Incognito Mode (Incognito Mode and this extension complement each other!)
3. Go to https://inbox.google.com
4. Click on the Power Google Inbox icon in the toolbar for more options
